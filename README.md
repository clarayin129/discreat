# Discreat
### Discreet help. Delivered.

Discreat is a way for domestic violence victims to submit a request for help through a food delivery app.
Discreat then connects with local police to dispatch assistance, aggregating data to be used in trial and
ensuring that trends in location and response time are logged.

We built the Discreat dashboard (to view live data, caller locations, and connect with police responders).
In Figma, we prototyped the process of making a Discreat request through a delivery app and logging onto the Discreat
website to access your data.
